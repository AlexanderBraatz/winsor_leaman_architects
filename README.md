## Why does this project exist?

I began my journey with this project at a networking event in Bristol, where I connected with the Winsor family. The family had a unique vision: they wanted to revamp the father's architecture firm website and, at the same time, provide his daughter, an aspiring UX designer, with a chance to gain real-world design and project experience.

The project was driven by three primary goals:

- **Developing a Modern, User-Friendly Digital Showcase** <br/>The aim was to create an engaging online platform to exhibit over 30 of the firm's architectural projects.
- **Streamlining Client Communication** <br/>A key requirement was to integrate a straightforward method for potential clients to contact the firm.
- **Fostering Collaboration** <br/>An essential part of the project was to collaborate closely with the UX designer, ensuring her design vision was effectively translated into the website.

To meet these goals, I steered the project by identifying and communicating the essential features needed, and led the development, deployment and maintenance. I made improvements over the original single page site by building a dynamic multi-page website. A lightweight architecture was used, including modular reusable components, client-side rendering and third-party services to ensure a swift and efficient delivery of the website, prioritising the client's needs and scalability.
